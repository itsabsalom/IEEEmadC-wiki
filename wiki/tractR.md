### about Darasa Lecturer app

2.0	Problem Definition
Tilling of land is a very intensive process. In 2006, almost 75% of Kenyans made their living through farming. Fortunately, most Kenyans who do farm have acres of land to their disposal but they lack the labour and or machinery to maximise use of the land. The best way to prepare land is through tilling it using a tractor but a mid sized tractor can cost upwards of 1.5 million Kenya Shillings. An amount that is too high for most farmers to afford.

TractR as a start-up provides a soliton to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals created by the United Nations General Assembly
Zero Hunger
